# Web Based Stock Market Dashboard

By: Dave Eum

Project Description/Outline: This data analytics tool is designed to pull data directly from quandl restnow API. The front-end tool allows the user to search for any NYSX stock which is then transformed using panda. I use matplotlib to analyze the data in 20 days, 10 week, 40 week Moving Average. This data analytics tool then will refresh the data visualization on front-end.
